I went through six years of primary school. 3years after the beginning of the middle school, I was admitted to Xingtai No.1 Middle School and entered its direct promotion class. Three years later, I  took the College Entrance Examination.Hard work pays off, I entered Xiamen University as I wished,and begin my college life.

I love running，and I once represented my class in the sports meeting and won the third place. I am also keen on literary life, and have participated in school art festivals.
